# chroma
Chroma is a web application, where you can experiment with RGB and HEX color codes, to find colors and also separate them into their respective Red, Green and Blue componenets, It was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The code is open source you can experiment with it and I'm still working on a better version because it has few malfunctions in it BUT IT IS GREAT and you should try it out
