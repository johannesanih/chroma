# chroma
Chroma is a web application, where you can experiment with RGB and HEX color codes, to find colors and also separate them into their respective Red, Green and Blue componenets, It was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

#It's Open Source
The code is open source and it is heavily commented so you can better understand the approach I used in writing the code and the whole logic of the program

#And Your Free And This Application Is Great
You can experiment with it and I'm still working on a better version because it has few malfunctions in it BUT IT IS GREAT and you should try it out
